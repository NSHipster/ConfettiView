A view that emits confetti with shapes, images, and text of your choosing
for a specified duration,
and then fades out.

```swift
import ConfettiView

let confettiView = ConfettiView()
confettiView.emit(with: [
  .text("üë®üèª"),
  .text("üì±"),
  .shape(.circle, .purple),
  .shape(.triangle, .lightGray),
  .image(star, .orange)
]) {
  // Optional completion handler fires when animation finishes.
}
```
